**AlcoCraft+** adds a new element to gameplay â€• a brewing keg for creating beer. Players can now craft their own beer using various ingredients, such as hops, sugar, apples and water (10+ recipes).

After brewing beer, players will experience different useful effects depending on ingredients used in brewing process. Some types of beer can increase the player's movement speed, while others can boost their strength and defense, and some may even grant the ability to see in the dark.
